# UFOs


## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage that allows a user to review UFO sightings. The webpage uses css for visual formatting and uses Java Script to filter the data by multiple criteria for an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by the date, city, state, country, and shape.

This is the initial landing page for the UFO Sightings site. By entering criteria into the filters on the left, different reported sightings will populate into the table on the right.

The image above shows the results of filtering by US sightings. I will add filters for California (CA) and shape (light) for more detailed results. Please See Below.

These filters will also update if you chose to change locations or shapes.

## Summary
The current setup of this site works well for filtering the existing data but we also have a column for duration that cannot be filitered as it currently exists in the data because it is a string. This information is critical for a detailed analysis of this type of data. In a future version of this site I would insist on creating a filter for the duration of the sighting which will also require the data to be updated. Another recommendation for further development would be a toggle for light/dark modes of the website for user preferrence.
